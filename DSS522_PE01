# Part 1
# Step 1: Create the text variable
text = """Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated."""

# Step 2: Define words to remove
words_to_remove = ['is', 'better', 'than']

# Step 3: Process the text
# Convert text to lower case and split it into words
words = text.lower().split()

# Step 4: Filter out unwanted words
filtered_text = ' '.join([word for word in words if word not in words_to_remove])

# Step 5: Print the final text
print(filtered_text)
